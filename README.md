# Laverinto-Videojuego

Final Project – 1st Year DAW (Web Application Development)

2D Video Game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Description

Laverinto-Videojuego is a 2D game where the player must escape from a maze by finding the correct path to complete the level.

The visual design features styled walls and grass-textured paths, creating a simple yet polished 2D environment.
The gameplay is inspired by the arcade dynamics of Tomb of the Mask and the classic grid-based movement of Pac-Man.

The game interface is in Spanish, as it was developed as part of an academic requirement.
